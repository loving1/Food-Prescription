The app and website for diabetes and heart disease preveniton

---------------------
The app outline can be found here:   https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1c6BA3CJXGILTh2T1RsbTdRUlk and below. I need to do the web interface as well. It can be the same flow, just bigger. 

Basically, the app would be able to: 

1) Log in and out <br>
2) Have a place to track body analysis and results like weiht, blood tests, nutrient assessments and fecal test results </br>
3) Have a place to track food intake. Need to see if this company has an API: https://www.eatwithava.com/ or a way to use the clarifai.com API (super simple) to at least recognize what food is in the photo. 
4) A way to track exercise. Ideally would sync with other devices.
5) A way to have them learn lessons each week and also take a quiz. 
6) Have a leaderboard where people who regularly post food, excercise the most, and also report back how they are feeling are reconized. Points are added and given in a profile. 
7) Accept payments.

Database

I currently have a back end using bluehost. Let me know and I can provide login info. 

All for now I think.
